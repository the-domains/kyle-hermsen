description: >-
  My Name Is Kyle Hermsen, I am a Cinematographer, Photographer and Camera
  Operator currently living in Denver, Colorado. I have a Bachelors of Science
  in Film Production and started my career in the Film Industry in Florida
  working for FYI Network, MLB Network, Disney, and Fox Sports. Florida is also
  where I met my wife Jordan. Her and I moved to Georgia where we welcomed our
  daughter Sophia. In Georgia I worked on numerous productions including the
  Spartan Race for NBC, traveling out of town to Florida and Alabama to work on
  Beachfront and Lakefront House hunting, and shooting the casting for Youâ€™re
  Back in the Room for Fox. We picked up in Georgia and moved across the country
  to Colorado. Here I have worked on Trading Playlists for Spotify and shooting
  the Dolly Parton Concert at Redrocks Amphitheater. In our off time we are
  currently exploring everything Colorado has to offer.
